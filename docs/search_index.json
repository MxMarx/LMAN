First, I simulated two independent neurons which increased in firing rate at separate at separate phases of song. The lower figure shows that the firing rate over neuron 2 changes with the distance from a spike in neuron one even though their is no causal relation between these neurons. Figure 4.1: Firing rate as a function of time during song for two independent neurons. Figure 4.2: Spike triggered average firing rate for independent two neurons during singing and silence. 4.1.2 Correlated neurons Next, I simulated data as described above, expect now neuron 2 has an increased probability of firing shortly after a spike from neuron 1. Figure 4.3: Firing rate as a function of time during song for two correlated neurons. Figure 4.4: Spike triggered average firing rate for correlated neurons during singing and silence. 4.2 Expected spike-triggered average For independent neurons with distinct time-varying song-locked firing rates, we can estimate the STA at time lag \\(\\tau\\) as \\(STA(\\tau) = \\frac{R_i(t) \\cdot R_j(t + \\tau)^T}{R_i(t) \\cdot R_i(t)^T}\\) where \\(R_i(t)\\) is the average firing rate of neuron i at time t in song. In other words, the STA for neuron i and j at time lag \\(\\tau\\) is the average firing rate of i at lag \\(\\tau\\), weighted by the probability density of j. The black lines in the following figures show that the expected STA matches the observed STA for independent neurons, but not correlated neurons. Figure 4.5: Expected STA calculated for independent neurons with the givin song-modulation. 4.3 Song-adjusted STA The song-adjusted STA is the expected STA subtracted from the observed STA. The STA is equal during song and silence, showing that this method works (at least on synthetic data)! Figure 4.6: Song-adjusted STA for independent and correlated neurons.
