# Trajectories

## Method
*   Find the point in VAE space where a neuron spikes
*   Find neighboring syllables trajectories within a radius from the query point
*   Measure the distance of the query trajectory from the centroid of it’s neighbors over time
*   For the null distribution, query points from other syllables at the same time offset

Not shown here, but whether or not a neuron spiked did not appear to influence a syllable’s distance to the syllable cluster centroid
Because of this, I’m not entirely confident that my method for finding the null distribution is good enough because I wasn’t really expecting an effect


```{r trajectories, out.width='100%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Divergence of the trajectory away from it's neighbors for after spiking and not spiking. Shaded areas are 95% CI"}
filenames = list.files(path = 'Figures/Trajectories/', 
                    pattern = 'divergence - Bird 7358', full.names = T)
knitr::include_graphics(filenames)
```
