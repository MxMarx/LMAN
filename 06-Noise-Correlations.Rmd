# Noise Correlations

## Synthetic Data

### Independent neurons 

I started by simulating data to validate the method of subtracting the song component.
First, I simulated two independent neurons which increased in firing rate at separate at separate phases of song.

The lower figure shows that the firing rate over neuron 2 changes with the distance from a spike in neuron one even though their is no causal relation between these neurons. 

```{R synthetic-data-uncorrelated-syllable, fig.cap='Firing rate as a function of time during song for two independent neurons.', out.width="75%", fig.align = "default"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Noise Correlations/noise - uncorrelated - syllable.png")
```


```{R synthetic-data-uncorrelated-STA, fig.cap='Spike triggered average firing rate for independent two neurons during singing and silence.', out.width="100%", fig.align = "default"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Noise Correlations/uncorrelated - STA - observed.png")
```

### Correlated neurons 

Next, I simulated data as described above, expect now neuron 2 has an increased probability of firing shortly after a spike from neuron 1.

```{R synthetic-data-correlated-syllable, fig.cap='Firing rate as a function of time during song for two correlated neurons.', out.width="75%", fig.align = "default"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Noise Correlations/noise - correlated - syllable.png")
```


```{R synthetic-data-correlated-STA, fig.cap='Spike triggered average firing rate for correlated neurons during singing and silence.', out.width="100%", fig.align = "default"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Noise Correlations/correlated - STA - observed.png")
```

## Expected spike-triggered average

For independent neurons with distinct time-varying song-locked firing rates, we can estimate the STA at time lag $\tau$ as $STA(\tau) = \frac{R_i(t) \cdot R_j(t + \tau)^T}{R_i(t) \cdot R_i(t)^T}$ where $R_i(t)$ is the average firing rate of neuron _i_ at time _t_ in song.

In other words, the STA for neuron _i_ and _j_ at time lag $\tau$ is the average firing rate of _i_ at lag $\tau$, weighted by the probability density of _j_.

The black lines in the following figures show that the expected STA matches the observed STA for independent neurons, but not correlated neurons.

```{R synthetic-data-expected-STA, fig.cap='Expected STA calculated for independent neurons with the givin song-modulation.', out.width="100%", fig.align = "default", fig.subcap=c('one plot', 'the other one')}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Noise Correlations/uncorrelated - STA.png")
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Noise Correlations/correlated - STA.png")

```

## Song-adjusted STA

The song-adjusted STA is the expected STA subtracted from the observed STA. The STA is equal during song and silence, showing that this method works (at least on synthetic data)!

```{R synthetic-data-song-adjusted-STA, fig.cap='Song-adjusted STA for independent and correlated neurons.', out.width="100%", fig.align = "default", fig.subcap=c('one plot', 'the other one')}
