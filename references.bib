	abstract = {The ability to generate variable movements is essential for learning and adjusting complex behaviours. This variability has been linked to the temporal irregularity of neuronal activity in the central nervous system. However, how neuronal irregularity actually translates into behavioural variability is unclear. Here we combine modelling, electrophysiological and behavioural studies to address this issue. We demonstrate that a model circuit comprising topographically organized and strongly recurrent neural networks can autonomously generate irregular motor behaviours. Simultaneous recordings of neurons in singing finches reveal that neural correlations increase across the circuit driving song variability, in agreement with the model predictions. Analysing behavioural data, we find remarkable similarities in the babbling statistics of 5–6-month-old human infants and juveniles from three songbird species and show that our model naturally accounts for these ‘universal’ statistics.},

	abstract = {Changes in behavior, due to environmental influences, development, and learning–, are commonly quantified based on a few hand-picked, domain-specific, features–,, (e.g. the average pitch of acoustic vocalizations) and assuming discrete classes of behaviors (e.g. distinct vocal syllables),,–. Such methods generalize poorly across different behaviors and model systems and may miss important components of change. Here we present a more general account of behavioral change based on nearest-neighbor statistics– and apply it to song development in a songbird, the zebra finch. First, we introduce “repertoire dating”, whereby each rendition of a behavior (e.g. each vocalization) is assigned a repertoire time, reflecting when similar renditions were typical in the behavioral repertoire. Repertoire time (rT) isolates the components of vocal variability congruent with the long-term changes due to vocal learning and development and stratifies the behavioral repertoire into regressions (rT {\textless} true production time, t), anticipations (rT {\textgreater} t), and typical renditions (rT ≈ t). Second, we obtain a holistic, yet low-dimensional, description of vocal change in terms of a stratified “behavioral trajectory”, revealing multiple, previously unrecognized, components of behavioral change on fast and slow timescales, as well as distinct patterns of overnight consolidation,,,,. Diurnal changes in regressions undergo only weak consolidation, whereas anticipations and typical renditions consolidate fully. Because of its generality, our non-parametric description of how behavior evolves relative to itself, rather than relative to a potentially arbitrary, experimenter-defined, goal,,, appears well-suited to compare learning and change across behaviors and species,, as well as biological and artificial systems.},

	abstract = {Practice of a complex motor gesture involves motor exploration to attain a better match to target, but little is known about the neural code for such exploration. We examine spiking in a premotor area of the songbird brain critical for song modification and quantify correlations between spiking and time in the motor sequence. While isolated spikes code for time in song during performance of song to a female bird, extended strings of spiking and silence, particularly bursts, code for time in song during undirected (solo) singing, or “practice.” Bursts code for particular times in song with more information than individual spikes, and this spike-spike synergy is significantly higher during undirected singing. The observed pattern information cannot be accounted for by a Poisson model with a matched time-varying rate, indicating that the precise timing of spikes in both bursts in undirected singing and isolated spikes in directed singing code for song with a temporal code. Temporal coding during practice supports the hypothesis that lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium neurons actively guide song modification at local instances in time. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This paper shows that bursts of spikes in the songbird brain during practice carry information about the output motor pattern. The brain’s code for song changes with social context, in performance versus practice. Synergistic combinations of spiking and silence code for time in the bird’s song. This is one of the first uses of information theory to quantify neural information about a motor output. This activity may guide changes to the song.},

	abstract = {Birdsong learning provides an ideal model system for studying temporally complex motor behavior. Guided by the well-characterized functional anatomy of the song system, we have constructed a computational model of the sensorimotor phase of song learning. Our model uses simple Hebbian and reinforcement learning rules and demonstrates the plausibility of a detailed set of hypotheses concerning sensory-motor interactions during song learning. The model focuses on the motor nuclei HVc and robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA) of zebra finches and incorporates the long-standing hypothesis that a series of song nuclei, the Anterior Forebrain Pathway (AFP), plays an important role in comparing the bird's own vocalizations with a previously memorized song, or “template.” This “AFP comparison hypothesis” is challenged by the significant delay that would be experienced by presumptive auditory feedback signals processed in the AFP. We propose that the AFP does not directly evaluate auditory feedback, but instead, receives an internally generated prediction of the feedback signal corresponding to each vocal gesture, or song “syllable.” This prediction, or “efference copy,” is learned in HVc by associating premotor activity in RA-projecting HVc neurons with the resulting auditory feedback registered within AFP-projecting HVc neurons. We also demonstrate how negative feedback “adaptation” can be used to separate sensory and motor signals within HVc. The model predicts that motor signals recorded in the AFP during singing carry sensory information and that the primary role for auditory feedback during song learning is to maintain an accurate efference copy. The simplicity of the model suggests that associational efference copy learning may be a common strategy for overcoming feedback delay during sensorimotor learning.},

Songbirds provide a marvelous animal model in which to study these phenomena. By use of a motorized microdrive to record the activity of single neurons in the singing bird, we are beginning to understand the circuits that generate complex vocal sequences. We describe recent experiments elucidating the role of premotor song-control nucleus HVC in the production of song. We find that HVC neurons projecting to premotor nucleus RA each generate a single burst of spikes at a particular time in the song and may form a sparse representation of temporal order. We incorporate this observation into a working hypothesis for the generation of vocal sequences in the songbird, and examine some implications for song learning.},
